            I’m a USAF veteran and current Computer Science student passionate about building practical, accessible, and
            well-crafted software. I enjoy both frontend and backend work and have hands-on experience with technologies
            like React, Node.js, and Python. When I’m not coding, I’m probably tinkering with hardware, exploring new
            frameworks, or learning something new.
